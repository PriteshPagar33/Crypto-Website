                <p>
                  Domo, the pseudonymous creator of the BRC-20 token standard,
                  announced that his organisation, Layer 1 Foundation (L1F),
                  will partner with Bitcoin infrastructure company UniSat. They
                  will serve as BRC-20‚Äôs lead maintainers, addressing governance
                  issues within the ecosystem. The BRC-20 token standard
                  operates on the Ordinals Protocol, enabling the trading of
                  digital assets other than BTC on the Bitcoin network. It has
                  sparked a broader discussion about the evolution and
                  governance of BRC-20 within the community, especially when
                  Unisat adopted the Ordinals Jubilee upgrade at the start of
                  2024 that aims to address the issue of ‚Äúcursed inscriptions‚Äù
                  by reclassifying them with positive numbers, enhancing
                  protocol development and governance. This was then opposed by
                  Domo, citing that the new tech might fragment the BRC-20
                  ecosystem. The conflict has since divided the crypto
                  community.

                  BTC reached a new ATH of $71,000 and ETH retook $4,000.

                  Last week‚Äôs crypto market price and volume indices were up
                  +11.34% and +29.09%, respectively, while the volatility index
                  fell by -28.38%. The price index has been growing successively
                  for seven weeks, demonstrating strong momentum in the market.
                  Last week‚Äôs bull run was likely driven by a combination of
                  news regarding higher-than-expected US unemployment data and
                  the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of
                  US$70,000 on 8 March. This surge came after the release of US
                  unemployment data. The unemployment rate of 3.9% exceeded
                  expectations of 3.7%. Higher-than-expected readings are
                  typically seen as negative or bearish for the USD, indicating
                  a decrease in value. This led to speculation that inflationary
                  pressures were diminishing because of the implementation of
                  restrictive economic policies. Moreover, BTC crossed $71,000
                  and reached a new all-time high on 11 March.

                  Please be informed that Crypto.com will support the Stratis
                  (STRAX) token swap. As a result, STRAX will be delisted from
                  the Crypto.com App on 20 March 2024, 1:00 UTC, and from the
                  Crypto.com Exchange on 20 March 2024, 2:00 UTC. Deposits, and
                  withdrawals of old STRAX on its native network will be
                  permanently removed and trading will be paused from 20 March
                  2024 onwards. You may incur a retrieval fee if deposits of
                  STRAX via its native network are made after 20 March.
                  Furthermore, fund retrieval may not be possible in some cases.
                  All Target Price Orders and Recurring Buys of STRAX after 20
                  March, 01:00 UTC, will be automatically terminated on the
                  Crypto.com App. All open STRAX orders for Spot trading will be
                  cancelled after 20 March, 02:00 UTC on the Crypto.com
                  Exchange. Deposits, and withdrawals of new STRAX will resume
                  at a later date via StratisEVM Chain only in the App and
                  Exchange.
