              Cryptocurrency – meaning and definition
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on
              banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can
              enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of
              being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real
              world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to
              an online database describing specific transactions. When you
              transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a
              public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. <br />
              <br />
              Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to
              verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in
              storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and
              to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security
              and safety. <br />
              <br /> The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in
              2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in
              cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times
              driving prices skyward.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-secondary">How does cryptocurrency work?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called
              blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by
              currency holders. <br />
              <br /> Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process
              called mining, which involves using computer power to solve
              complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can
              also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them
              using cryptographic wallets. <br />
              <br />
              If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What
              you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of
              measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.{" "}
              <br />
              <br /> Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009,
              cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are
              still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in
              the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other
              financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-secondary">Cryptocurrency examples</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known
              include: <br />
              <br />
              <span id="ttf">Bitcoin:</span> <br /> Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was
              the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded.
              The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed
              to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose
              precise identity remains unknown. <br />
              <br /> <span id="ttf">Ethereum:</span> <br />
              Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own
              cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most
              popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. <br />
              <br /> <span id="ttf">Litecoin:</span> <br /> This currency is
              most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new
              innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more
              transactions. <br />
              <br />
              <span id="ttf">Ripple:</span> <br />
              Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012.
              Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not
              just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various
              banks and financial institutions. Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are
              collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from the
              original.

            <h3 class="heading-secondary">How to buy cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              You may be wondering how to buy cryptocurrency safely. There are
              typically three steps involved. These are: <br />
              <br />
              <span id="ttf">Step 1: Choosing a platform:</span> <br />
              <br /> The first step is deciding which platform to use.
              Generally, you can choose between a traditional broker or
              dedicated cryptocurrency exchange: <br />
              <br />
              Traditional brokers. These are online brokers who offer ways to
              buy and sell cryptocurrency, as well as other financial assets
              like stocks, bonds, and ETFs. These platforms tend to offer lower
              trading costs but fewer crypto features. <br />
              <br /> Cryptocurrency exchanges. There are many cryptocurrency
              exchanges to choose from, each offering different
              cryptocurrencies, wallet storage, interest-bearing account
              options, and more. Many exchanges charge asset-based fees. <br />{" "}
              <br /> When comparing different platforms, consider which
              cryptocurrencies are on offer, what fees they charge, their
              security features, storage and withdrawal options, and any
              educational resources. <br />
              <br /> <span id="ttf">Step 2: Funding your account :</span>
              <br />
              <br /> Once you have chosen your platform, the next step is to
              fund your account so you can begin trading. Most crypto exchanges
              allow users to purchase crypto using fiat (i.e.,
              government-issued) currencies such as the US Dollar, the British
              Pound, or the Euro using their debit or credit cards – although
              this varies by platform. <br />
              <br /> Crypto purchases with credit cards are considered risky,
              and some exchanges don't support them. Some credit card companies
              don't allow crypto transactions either. This is because
              cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and it is not advisable to
              risk going into debt — or potentially paying high credit card
              transaction fees — for certain assets. <br />
              <br /> Some platforms will also accept ACH transfers and wire
              transfers. The accepted payment methods and time taken for
              deposits or withdrawals differ per platform. Equally, the time
              taken for deposits to clear varies by payment method. <br />
              <br />
              An important factor to consider is fees. These include potential
              deposit and withdrawal transaction fees plus trading fees. Fees
              will vary by payment method and platform, which is something to
              research at the outset. <br />
              <br />
              <span id="ttf">Step 2: Step 3: Placing an order :</span>
              <br />
              <br />
              You can place an order via your broker's or exchange's web or
              mobile platform. If you are planning to buy cryptocurrencies, you
              can do so by selecting "buy," choosing the order type, entering
              the amount of cryptocurrencies you want to purchase, and
              confirming the order. The same process applies to "sell" orders.{" "}
              <br />
              There are also other ways to invest in crypto. These include
              payment services like PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo, which allow
              users to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. In addition, there
              are the following investment vehicles: <br />
              <br /> <span id="ttf">Bitcoin trusts:</span> You can buy shares of
              Bitcoin trusts with a regular brokerage account. These vehicles
              give retail investors exposure to crypto through the stock market.{" "}
              <br />
              <br /> <span id="ttf">Bitcoin mutual funds:</span> There are
              Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin mutual funds to choose from. <br />
              <br />
              <span id="ttf">Blockchain stocks or ETFs:</span>
              You can also indirectly invest in crypto through blockchain
              companies that specialize in the technology behind crypto and
              crypto transactions. Alternatively, you can buy stocks or ETFs of
              companies that use blockchain technology. <br /> The best option
              for you will depend on your investment goals and risk appetite
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-secondary">How to store cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you need to store it
              safely to protect it from hacks or theft. Usually, cryptocurrency
              is stored in crypto wallets, which are physical devices or online
              software used to store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies
              securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy
              for you to store directly through the platform. However, not all
              exchanges or brokers automatically provide wallet services for
              you. <br />
              <br />
              There are different wallet providers to choose from. The terms
              “hot wallet” and “cold wallet” are used: <br />
              <br /> Hot wallet storage: "hot wallets" refer to crypto storage
              that uses online software to protect the private keys to your
              assets. <br />
              <br /> Cold wallet storage: Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets (also
              known as hardware wallets) rely on offline electronic devices to
              securely store your private keys. Typically, cold wallets tend to
              charge fees, while hot wallets don't.

              Cryptocurrency fraud and cryptocurrency scams
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Unfortunately, cryptocurrency crime is on the rise. Cryptocurrency
              scams include: <br />
              <br /> Fake websites: Bogus sites which feature fake testimonials
              and crypto jargon promising massive, guaranteed returns, provided
              you keep investing. <br />
              <br />
              Virtual Ponzi schemes: Cryptocurrency criminals promote
              non-existent opportunities to invest in digital currencies and
              create the illusion of huge returns by paying off old investors
              with new investors’ money. One scam operation, BitClub Network,
              raised more than $700 million before its perpetrators were
              indicted in December 2019. <br />
              <br />
              "Celebrity" endorsements: Scammers pose online as billionaires or
              well-known names who promise to multiply your investment in a
              virtual currency but instead steal what you send. They may also
              use messaging apps or chat rooms to start rumours that a famous
              businessperson is backing a specific cryptocurrency. Once they
              have encouraged investors to buy and driven up the price, the
              scammers sell their stake, and the currency reduces in value.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              Romance scams: The FBI warns of a trend in online dating scams,
              where tricksters persuade people they meet on dating apps or
              social media to invest or trade in virtual currencies. The FBI’s
              Internet Crime Complaint Centre fielded more than 1,800 reports of
              crypto-focused romance scams in the first seven months of 2021,
              with losses reaching $133 million. <br />
              <br />
              Otherwise, fraudsters may pose as legitimate virtual currency
              traders or set up bogus exchanges to trick people into giving them
              money. Another crypto scam involves fraudulent sales pitches for
              individual retirement accounts in cryptocurrencies. Then there is
              straightforward cryptocurrency hacking, where criminals break into
              the digital wallets where people store their virtual currency to
              steal it.

            <h3 class="heading-secondary">Is cryptocurrency safe?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology.
              Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into
              "blocks" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical
              process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency
              transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with. <br />
              <br /> In addition, transactions require a two-factor
              authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter
              a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might
              have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your
              personal cell phone. <br />
              <br />
              While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies
              are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks have cost
              cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the
              tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, making them
              two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018. <br />
              <br /> Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual
              currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can
              create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or
              big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are subject to far less
              regulatory protection than traditional financial products like
              stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. <br />

              Four tips to invest in cryptocurrency safely <br />
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              According to Consumer Reports, all investments carry risk, but
              some experts consider cryptocurrency to be one of the riskier
              investment choices out there. If you are planning to invest in
              cryptocurrencies, these tips can help you make educated choices.{" "}
              <br />
              Research exchanges: <br />
              <br />
              Before you invest, learn about cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s
              estimated that there are over 500 exchanges to choose from. Do
              your research, read reviews, and talk with more experienced
              investors before moving forward. <br />
              Know how to store your digital currency: <br />
              If you buy cryptocurrency, you have to store it. You can keep it
              on an exchange or in a digital wallet. While there are different
              kinds of wallets, each has its benefits, technical requirements,
              and security. As with exchanges, you should investigate your
              storage choices before investing. <br />
              Diversify your investments: <br />
              <br />
              Diversification is key to any good investment strategy, and this
              holds true when you are investing in cryptocurrency. Don't put all
              your money in Bitcoin, for example, just because that's the name
              you know. There are thousands of options, and it's better to
              spread your investment across several currencies. <br />
              <br />
              Prepare for volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly
              volatile, so be prepared for ups and downs. You will see dramatic
              swings in prices. If your investment portfolio or mental wellbeing
              can't handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for
              you. <br />
              Cryptocurrency is all the rage right now, but remember, it is
              still in its relative infancy and is considered highly
              speculative. Investing in something new comes with challenges, so
              be prepared. If you plan to participate, do your research, and
              invest conservatively to start. <br />
              One of the best ways you can stay safe online is by using a
              comprehensive antivirus. Kaspersky Internet Security defends you
              from malware infections, spyware, data theft and protects your
              online payments using bank-grade encryption. <br />
